![EPSM Demo](docs/img/DEMO.png)

## What is this?

**Edgeware++ Pack Settings Maker (EPSM)** is a companion tool for [Edgeware++](https://github.com/araten10/EdgewarePlusPlus). **EPSM** helps create the settings for your custom **Edgeware++** pack by using a graphical web interface.

## How does it work?

1. You use **EPSM** to generate a `pack.yml` settings file.
2. You use **Edgeware++**'s built-in [**Pack Tool**](https://github.com/araten10/EdgewarePlusPlus/tree/main/pack_tool) to compile your media files and `pack.yml` into a pack that can be imported into **Edgeware++**. 

## How to Use

### Prerequisites

- Make sure that you have [installed **Edgeware++** onto your Windows/Linux computer](https://github.com/araten10/EdgewarePlusPlus/releases). This comes with the **Edgeware++** program and the **Pack Tool**.

### Quickstart (for experienced Pack Makers)

If you already know how to make Edgeware++ packs (or you prefer to learn by experimenting), you can follow this guide to get started quickly:

1. Use Edgeware++'s built-in **Pack Tool**. Instructions can be found in the [README for the Pack Tool](https://github.com/araten10/EdgewarePlusPlus/tree/main/pack_tool) to create a new working folder for your pack
2. Open [**EPSM**]() and use it to generate a `pack.yml`
3. Replace your pack's default `pack.yml` with the one you generated with **EPSM**
