# Lesson 2: Changing how your pack behaves

In this lesson, we continue building the **Fruitware** pack we started building in [Lesson 1](../lessons/01.md).

## Edgeware++ Settings and `config.json`

**Edgeware++** lets you change many settings that control how an Edgeware session behaves. The simplest way to change these settings is through the built-in config menu. This menu lets users tweak their experience to their liking. But when you make an Edgeware++ pack, you can package "suggested settings" that your users can optionally import to experience your pack in the way you intended. You can do this by including a custom `config.json` file with your pack. The settings from this file will show up as "suggested config settings" in Edgeware++'s config menu. 

For **Fruitware**, we want the following experience for our users:
1. A slow, calm experience 
2. Popups should stick around long enough for users to really appreciate the fruits in our pack. But we don't want Popups to flood the screen, so they should eventually disappear
3. Our pack includes images, videos and audio files. So Image Popups, Video Popups and Audio Popups should be enabled. 

This means we need to ensure the following settings are in our `config.json`:
1. For a slow experience:
- `delay` should be set to be longer than `5000` milliseconds (5 seconds) so that it takes at least 5 seconds before a new Popup appears.
2. To make sure Popups don't immediately disappear:
- set `timeoutPopups` to `1` to allow Popups to expire after some time
- set `popupTimeout` to about `30` seconds
3. To enable Image Popups, Video Popups and Audio Popups:
- set `popupMod` to a value higher than `0` (max `100`) to make sure Image Popups can appear
- set `vidMod` to a value higher than `0` (max `100`) to make sure Video Popups can appear
- set `videoVolume` to a value higher than `0` (max `100`) if we want to make sure Video Popups can be heard
- set `audioMod` to a value higher than `0` (max `100`) to make sure Audio Popups can appear
- set `audioVolume` to a value higher than `0` (max `100`) to make sure Audio Popups can be heard

To create a `config.json`, you can directly create the file in the final *built* folder for your pack. However for this tutorial series, we want to use `pack.yml` to generate everything because it makes things easier in the long term.

### Generating `config.json` with `pack.yml` and **EPSM**

![Configuring config.json in EPSM](../img/02-EPSM-EDGEWARE-APP-SETTINGS.png)

We can manually set config values in our `pack.yml`, but as we discussed in the last lesson, it's easier to use **EPSM** for everything but small changes. To add config settings with **EPSM**, we'll start by uploading the exisiting `pack.yml` file from our working folder to **EPSM** so that we don't lose the info settings we made in the previous lesson.

#### Manually setting config settings in **EPSM**

We'll then click the option to generate "EDGEWARE APP SETTINGS (config.json)" and check the `General Popup Settings?`, `Image Popup Settings?`, `Audio Popup Settings` and `Video Popup Settings?` options and set our desired settings.

**IMPORTANT**: When you enable a config settings category in **EPSM**, all the settings in that category get default values set. This might be annoying if you don't want to set values for all the settings in that category. For now, the best way to remove unwanted settings is to manually edit the `pack.yml` after generation.

#### Import an existing `config.json`

What happens if you want to reuse an existing `config.json` from another pack or export your config settings as a preset that you can use for multiple packs? **EPSM** lets you import/export `config.json` files. If there's a pack whose `config.json` you want to use as a starting point, this is how you can do it.

For example, if I have a valid config file called `vegetables-settings.json`, I can load it with **EPSM** and use it as a starting point.

**IMPORTANT**: a JSON config file can be named anything when importing/exporting from **EPSM**, but Edgeware++ expects that your pack's config file is named exactly `config.json`.

## Recompile Pack with new config settings

After updating `pack.yml`, rebuild a test pack and you should now see that your pack now also includes a `config.json` with the settings you added earlier.

If you open Edgeware++'s config menu and switch to your pack, you should see that your pack now has some suggested settings. If you click "Load Pack Configuration", and go through the menu, you should see that your pack's suggested config settings have been applied.

**IMPORTANT**: Your `config.json` will only affect the settings that it defines. Any other settings will be left as whatever the user had configured before (this includes settings set by other packs).

## Next Steps

In the [next tutorial](../lessons/03.md), we'll be using **EPSM** to put the fruits in our **Fruitware** pack into different Moods (i.e categories).
