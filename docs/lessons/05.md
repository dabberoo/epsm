# Lesson 5: Climax and Ending Notes

If you followed the entire tutorial series, then congratulations! You now know how to make Edgeware++ packs with the **Pack Tool** and **EPSM**.

You should now know how to use **EPSM** and the **Pack Tool** to generate all the main config files used in an Edgeware++ pack (`info.json`, `config.json`, `index.json` and `corruption.json`) and make changes to suit your pack.

## What's Next?

There's a lot we didn't cover in the tutorial series. But you should now know enough to experiment with Edgeware++'s other features.

Did you see a pack that does something different and interesting? Take a look at its config files to see what you can learn from it.

Are you curious about the many settings we didn't touch during the tutorial? Experiment with them! **EPSM** provides a description for each setting so you know how it's used in Edgeware++. Edgeware++'s config menu also describes many of its modes and settings, so you can also learn from that. 

Interested in adding more advanced functionality to you pack? You can check out [Edgeware++ scripting](https://github.com/araten10/EdgewarePlusPlus/blob/main/scripting.md) next!
